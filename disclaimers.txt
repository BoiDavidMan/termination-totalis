disclaimer:

this mod contains flashing lights
if you're sensitive to flashing lights, turn off flashing lights in the main game's options menu
this disclaimer will show up before each song that has flashing lights no matter what, I don't want people to die because of me

this mod contains;
low-tier violence - there's a gore add-on if you want it ;]
some swearing - only during dialogue, some mid-song animations and occasionally Lord X's rap songs
loud sounds - it's a creepypasta mod, what did you expect
some absolute fuckin' bangers - obviously

if there's anything you guys are sensitive towards, feel free to tell me, I wanna make this mod as accessible as possible
unless you're sensitive to crucial stuff like fast movements, I'm not gonna remove basic stuff like that (idek why you would even play a sonic exe fan mod of all things if you were sensitive to fast movements, but whatever)
